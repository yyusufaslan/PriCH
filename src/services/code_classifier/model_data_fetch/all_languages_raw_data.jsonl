The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola <strong>'cans'</strong> (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the <em>green rectangle</em> with scale and rotation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/irQtR.png\" alt=\"Template matching\" /></p>\n<p>Some constraints on the project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The background could be very noisy.</li>\n<li>The <em>can</em> could have any <em>scale</em> or <em>rotation</em> or even orientation (within reasonable limits).</li>\n<li>The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).</li>\n<li>There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the <em>can</em>!</li>\n<li>The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely &quot;too much&quot; on color detection).</li>\n<li>The <em>can</em> could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.</li>\n<li>There could be no <em>can</em> at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Byw82.png\" alt=\"Total fail\" /></p>\n<p>I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:</p>\n<p><strong>Language</strong>: Done in C++ using <a href=\"http://opencv.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OpenCV</a> library.</p>\n<p><strong>Pre-processing</strong>: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Changing color domain from RGB to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV\" rel=\"noreferrer\">HSV</a> and filtering based on &quot;red&quot; hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.\n<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ktdAB.png\" alt=\"Binarized image\" /></li>\n<li>Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.</li>\n<li>Using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Canny Edge Detection Filter</a> to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.\n<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/F9319.png\" alt=\"Contour detection\" /></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Algorithm</strong>: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0123725380\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> awesome book on feature extraction and called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_Hough_transform\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Generalized Hough Transform</a> (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).</li>\n<li>It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.</li>\n<li>It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will &quot;learn&quot;.</li>\n<li>Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wxrT1.png\" alt=\"GHT\" /></p>\n<p>Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...</p>\n<p><strong>Results</strong>: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is <strong>extremely slow</strong>! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.</li>\n<li>It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)</li>\n<li>Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.</li>\n<li>In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How do I improve my <strong>specific</strong> algorithm, using <strong>exclusively OpenCV</strong> features, to resolve the <strong>four specific</strong> issues mentioned?</p>\n", "language": "cpp"}

I thought that this should make no difference, but the opposite is the case.</p>\n\n<h2>The (absolutely crazy) results</h2>\n\n<p>I compile it like this (g++ version: Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1):</p>\n\n<pre><code>g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here are the results on my <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_%28microarchitecture%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Haswell</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_%28microarchitecture%29#Desktop_processors\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Core i7-4770K</a> CPU @ 3.50&nbsp;GHz, running <code>test 1</code> (so 1&nbsp;MB random data):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.401554 sec   <strong>26.113&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.759822 sec   <strong>13.8003&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As you see, the throughput of the <code>uint64_t</code> version is <strong>only half</strong> the one of the <code>unsigned</code> version! The problem seems to be that different assembly gets generated, but why? First, I thought of a compiler bug, so I tried <code>clang++</code> (Ubuntu <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Clang</a> version 3.4-1ubuntu3):</p>\n\n<pre><code>clang++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 teest.cpp -o test\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Result: <code>test 1</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.398293 sec   <strong>26.3267 GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.680954 sec   <strong>15.3986 GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, it is almost the same result and is still strange. <em>But now it gets super strange.</em> I replace the buffer size that was read from input with a constant <code>1</code>, so I change:</p>\n\n<pre><code>uint64_t size = atol(argv[1]) &lt;&lt; 20;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to</p>\n\n<pre><code>uint64_t size = 1 &lt;&lt; 20;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thus, the compiler now knows the buffer size at compile time. Maybe it can add some optimizations! Here are the numbers for <code>g++</code>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.509156 sec   <strong>20.5944&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.508673 sec   <strong>20.6139&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, both versions are equally fast. However, the <code>unsigned</code> <strong>got even slower</strong>! It dropped from <code>26</code> to <code>20 GB/s</code>, thus replacing a non-constant by a constant value lead to a <strong>deoptimization</strong>. Seriously, I have no clue what is going on here! But now to <code>clang++</code> with the new version:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.677009 sec   <strong>15.4884&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.676909 sec   <strong>15.4906&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Wait, what?</em> Now, both versions dropped to the <strong>slow</strong> number of 15&nbsp;GB/s. Thus, replacing a non-constant by a constant value even lead to slow code in <strong>both</strong> cases for Clang!</p>\n\n<p>I asked a colleague with an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Bridge_%28microarchitecture%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ivy Bridge</a> CPU to compile my benchmark. He got similar results, so it does not seem to be Haswell. Because two compilers produce strange results here, it also does not seem to be a compiler bug. We do not have an AMD CPU here, so we could only test with Intel.</p>\n\n<h2>More madness, please!</h2>\n\n<p>Take the first example (the one with <code>atol(argv[1])</code>) and put a <code>static</code> before the variable, i.e.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>static uint64_t size=atol(argv[1])&lt;&lt;20;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here are my results in g++:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.396728 sec   <strong>26.4306 GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.509484 sec   <strong>20.5811 GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Yay, yet another alternative</em>. We still have the fast 26&nbsp;GB/s with <code>u32</code>, but we managed to get <code>u64</code> at least from the 13&nbsp;GB/s to the 20&nbsp;GB/s version! <strong>On my collegue's PC, the <code>u64</code> version became even faster than the <code>u32</code> version, yielding the fastest result of all.</strong> Sadly, this only works for <code>g++</code>, <code>clang++</code> does not seem to care about <code>static</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>My question</h2>\n\n<p>Can you explain these results? Especially:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How can there be such a difference between <code>u32</code> and <code>u64</code>?</li>\n<li>How can replacing a non-constant by a constant buffer size trigger <em>less optimal code</em>?</li>\n<li>How can the insertion of the <code>static</code> keyword make the <code>u64</code> loop faster? Even faster than the original code on my collegue's computer!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I know that optimization is a tricky territory, however, I never thought that such small changes can lead to a <strong>100% difference</strong> in execution time and that small factors like a constant buffer size can again mix results totally. Of course, I always want to have the version that is able to popcount 26&nbsp;GB/s. The only reliable way I can think of is copy paste the assembly for this case and use inline assembly. This is the only way I can get rid of compilers that seem to go mad on small changes. What do you think? Is there another way to reliably get the code with most performance?</p>\n\n<h2>The Disassembly</h2>\n\n<p>Here is the disassembly for the various results:</p>\n\n<p>26&nbsp;GB/s version from <strong>g++ / u32 / non-const bufsize</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0x400af8:\nlea 0x1(%rdx),%eax\npopcnt (%rbx,%rax,8),%r9\nlea 0x2(%rdx),%edi\npopcnt (%rbx,%rcx,8),%rax\nlea 0x3(%rdx),%esi\nadd %r9,%rax\npopcnt (%rbx,%rdi,8),%rcx\nadd $0x4,%edx\nadd %rcx,%rax\npopcnt (%rbx,%rsi,8),%rcx\nadd %rcx,%rax\nmov %edx,%ecx\nadd %rax,%r14\ncmp %rbp,%rcx\njb 0x400af8\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>13&nbsp;GB/s version from <strong>g++ / u64 / non-const bufsize</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0x400c00:\npopcnt 0x8(%rbx,%rdx,8),%rcx\npopcnt (%rbx,%rdx,8),%rax\nadd %rcx,%rax\npopcnt 0x10(%rbx,%rdx,8),%rcx\nadd %rcx,%rax\npopcnt 0x18(%rbx,%rdx,8),%rcx\nadd $0x4,%rdx\nadd %rcx,%rax\nadd %rax,%r12\ncmp %rbp,%rdx\njb 0x400c00\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>15&nbsp;GB/s version from <strong>clang++ / u64 / non-const bufsize</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0x400e50:\npopcnt (%r15,%rcx,8),%rdx\nadd %rbx,%rdx\npopcnt 0x8(%r15,%rcx,8),%rsi\nadd %rdx,%rsi\npopcnt 0x10(%r15,%rcx,8),%rdx\nadd %rsi,%rdx\npopcnt 0x18(%r15,%rcx,8),%rbx\nadd %rdx,%rbx\nadd $0x4,%rcx\ncmp %rbp,%rcx\njb 0x400e50\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>20&nbsp;GB/s version from <strong>g++ / u32&amp;u64 / const bufsize</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0x400a68:\npopcnt (%rbx,%rdx,1),%rax\npopcnt 0x8(%rbx,%rdx,1),%rcx\nadd %rax,%rcx\npopcnt 0x10(%rbx,%rdx,1),%rax\nadd %rax,%rcx\npopcnt 0x18(%rbx,%rdx,1),%rsi\nadd $0x20,%rdx\nadd %rsi,%rcx\nadd %rcx,%rbp\ncmp $0x100000,%rdx\njne 0x400a68\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>15&nbsp;GB/s version from <strong>clang++ / u32&amp;u64 / const bufsize</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0x400dd0:\npopcnt (%r14,%rcx,8),%rdx\nadd %rbx,%rdx\npopcnt 0x8(%r14,%rcx,8),%rsi\nadd %rdx,%rsi\npopcnt 0x10(%r14,%rcx,8),%rdx\nadd %rsi,%rdx\npopcnt 0x18(%r14,%rcx,8),%rbx\nadd %rdx,%rbx\nadd $0x4,%rcx\ncmp $0x20000,%rcx\njb 0x400dd0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Interestingly, the fastest (26&nbsp;GB/s) version is also the longest! It seems to be the only solution that uses <code>lea</code>. Some versions use <code>jb</code> to jump, others use <code>jne</code>. But apart from that, all versions seem to be comparable. I don't see where a 100% performance gap could originate from, but I am not too adept at deciphering assembly. The slowest (13&nbsp;GB/s) version looks even very short and good. Can anyone explain this?</p>\n\n<h2>Lessons learned</h2>\n\n<p>No matter what the answer to this question will be; I have learned that in really hot loops <em>every</em> detail can matter, <em>even details that do not seem to have any association to the hot code</em>. I have never thought about what type to use for a loop variable, but as you see such a minor change can make a <em>100%</em> difference! Even the storage type of a buffer can make a huge difference, as we saw with the insertion of the <code>static</code> keyword in front of the size variable! In the future, I will always test various alternatives on various compilers when writing really tight and hot loops that are crucial for system performance.</p>\n\n<p>The interesting thing is also that the performance difference is still so high although I have already unrolled the loop four times. So even if you unroll, you can still get hit by major performance deviations. Quite interesting.</p>\n", "language": "cpp"}

Therefore, I should represent it with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var football_team = new List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>The ordering of this list represent the order in which the players are listed in the roster.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But I realize later that teams also have other properties, besides the mere list of players, that must be recorded.

The most similar and relevant existing structure is <code>List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;</code>, so I will inherit from it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class FootballTeam : List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; \n{ \n    public string TeamName; \n    public int RunningTotal \n}\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But it turns out that <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/5376343/1042555\">a guideline says you shouldn't inherit from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code></a>. I'm thoroughly confused by this guideline in two respects.</p>\n\n<h2>Why not?</h2>\n\n<p>Apparently <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/5376358/1042555\"><code>List</code> is somehow optimized for performance</a>. How so? What performance problems will I cause if I extend <code>List</code>? What exactly will break?</p>\n\n<p>Another reason I've seen is that <code>List</code> is provided by Microsoft, and I have no control over it, so <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5376203/inherit-listt#comment6077237_5376343\">I cannot change it later, after exposing a \"public API\"</a>. But I struggle to understand this. What is a public API and why should I care? If my current project does not and is not likely to ever have this public API, can I safely ignore this guideline? If I do inherit from <code>List</code> <em>and</em> it turns out I need a public API, what difficulties will I have?</p>\n\n<p>Why does it even matter? A list is a list. What could possibly change? What could I possibly want to change?</p>\n\n<p>And lastly, if Microsoft did not want me to inherit from <code>List</code>, why didn't they make the class <code>sealed</code>?</p>\n\n<h2>What else am I supposed to use?</h2>\n\n<p>Apparently, for custom collections, Microsoft has provided a <code>Collection</code> class which should be extended instead of <code>List</code>. But this class is very bare, and does not have many useful things, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1474863/addrange-to-a-collection\">such as <code>AddRange</code></a>, for instance. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/12039943/1042555\">jvitor83's answer</a> provides a performance rationale for that particular method, but how is a slow <code>AddRange</code> not better than no <code>AddRange</code>?</p>\n\n<p>Inheriting from <code>Collection</code> is way more work than inheriting from <code>List</code>, and I see no benefit. Surely Microsoft wouldn't tell me to do extra work for no reason, so I can't help feeling like I am somehow misunderstanding something, and inheriting <code>Collection</code> is actually not the right solution for my problem.</p>\n\n<p>I've seen suggestions such as implementing <code>IList</code>. Just no. This is dozens of lines of boilerplate code which gains me nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, some suggest wrapping the <code>List</code> in something: </p>\n\n<pre><code>class FootballTeam \n{ \n    public List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; Players; \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are two problems with this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>It makes my code needlessly verbose. I must now call <code>my_team.Players.Count</code> instead of just <code>my_team.Count</code>. Thankfully, with C# I can define indexers to make indexing transparent, and forward all the methods of the internal <code>List</code>... But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work?</p></li>\n<li><p>It just plain doesn't make any sense. A football team doesn't \"have\" a list of players. It <em>is</em> the list of players. You don't say \"John McFootballer has joined SomeTeam's players\". You say \"John has joined SomeTeam\". You don't add a letter to \"a string's characters\", you add a letter to a string.
